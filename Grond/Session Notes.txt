Meet time was set to 2 p.m. according to a message received at 9 a.m. Fortunately, the meet was a bar in Tacoma, so Grond decided to walk. Taking off his combat helmet to raise fewer eyebrows at the border, he put on the respirator matching his suit, making sure it was set to his usual white and red.

With an 8m long snake, a well dressed elf, a blue oni, and a well-dressed troll with a shield on his back assembled in the bar, the bartender took one look at them and directed them to the back room with a silent nod of his head. Inside, they found a dwarf in a decent suit--not top rack, but certainly custom. 18k per head, and a package needing transport from the south to the north side. Grond did what he was told--shut up and look intimidating, as Kobold negotiated slightly higher pay of 20k.

He pulled out a holoprojector, showing them a locked metal case about 30cm by 30cm by 60cm, saying it was in the crime mall in Puyallup at 10 p.m. He needed it in the Everett docks by night. 

They began interrogating the Johnson, getting the following information out of him: There were others interested in intercepting and potentially destroying it. When asked about explosives, he answered it was stable so long as the case was closed. In theory, opfor would be extremests, not police or corps. If the case was damaged, it would become worthless. Checkpoints wouldn't explicitly be a problem for licensing, but might want to open it. The pickup was from a rough looking pair of orks, and the receiver was a container box in Everett. There were no emissions, magical or otherwise.

With the questions complete, he left the room. Grond immediately went and got a drink from the bar. When he got back, the team was planning. While they planned a route, Grond thought about Puyallup's crime mall, and remembered that despite Puyallup being mostly Gianelli controlled, they left the crime mall well alone, respecting the unspoken ceasefire.

Kobold asked to put some stuff in the trunk, and while she offered a gun both Thresher and Grond declined. She briefly considered asking Grond to jump from car to car, should the need arise, but quickly rejected that idea.

The team decided to send Grond and Thresher as an away team at the mall. The sun was setting as they arrived in the Puyallup barrens, but the mall was still active. Grond scanned the parking lot as they exited the car, noting all the cool cars!

They made their way through the mall, Grond with mace in hand, and Thresher knocked on the door while Grond kept watch. The viewslot slid open.

"Who the hell are ya?"

"We're here for a package," replied Thresher, giving the password.

"Alright, get in here."

As Thresher went in, Grond noted some attention on the transaction, drawing his shield and blocking the door with his body.

Thresher came out, and the door slammed shut, with the sound a heavy bar sliding into place, behind them. As they began to move, the looky-loos began moving to intercept. All Human. Thresher recognized them as Night Hunter colours. As Thresher blended in with the crowd, as Grond broke his line of sight with their pursuers, a dance to confuse the night hunters. They began to run.

Thresher decked one of them, not quite knocking them out, as Grond charged, catching one square on the jaw with his mace, twisting his neck beyond what was normally possible for humans. One of them screamed expletetives and unloaded into Grond, achieving nothing, while the others engaged Thresher in melee with similar results. Thresher took the next one out, as Grond gave the shooter a disappointed look before swinging at the final Night Hunter engaged with Thresher. Grond grazed the spikes on his helmet, and he took another swing at Tresher, corectly judging he wouldn't be able to take out the troll in any reasonable amount of time. Thresher took a hit, but remained unphased. Another hail of bullets pinged off Grond's shield, then Thresher gripped and crushed the remaining melee combatant, making him bleed. Asp's spirit then arrived, firing an elemental blast at the same person, electrocuting him. Kobold, with a hacked commlink, realized that audiovisual data was being transmitted. The remaining Night Hunter retreated, tossing a grenade. Grond dove onto in, blocking the blast with his body, then standing up and glaring at the man. "Please, sir, may I have some more?" he said in an attempt to intimidate. It failed, but Thresher quickly finished the man off.

Kobold traced the feed off the commlink, while Asp incapacitated the four Night Hunters that had arrived in the parking lot, creating a floor of ice causing them to slip. Kobold attempted to damage the other end of the signal they had followed as the Night Hunters continued to slip.

Thresher and Grond began sprinting for the exit. Thresher exited first, and Asp drifted the car around, picking him up, while Kobold continued attacking the enemy PAN. Grond ran towards the new opfor, but Asp swung around, intercepting. In the car, Grond finally calmed down enough to not try to keep fighting.

Asp peeled away, following one of their pre-planned routes with modification at Thresher's advice based on the new knowledge of who they were dealing with. A drone followed them, but Kobold hacked it, killing the rigger and causing it to crash.

Asp got them to Everett in no time flat, and Kobold's meat body, who was completely unrelated to the "AI" Kobold, got our of the trunk and dry heaved on the ground.
