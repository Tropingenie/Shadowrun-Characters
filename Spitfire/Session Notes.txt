Spitfire hadn't gotten as much work done on preparing the helo as she wanted, but had moved on to trying to figure out how their RCC work. A call from Tlaloc came in, notifying them of a job.

Still distracted, they made their way to the meeting location, a once nice beach on the peninsula in Laurelhurst: The Laurelhurst Beach Club. Nobody else was around, and it wasn't long before Spitfire saw "Pinto," Fancy's Shin-Hyung, and a modified, magical self-driving bicycle appeared as 9 p.m. rolled around.

Spitfire rolled down the window, placing a folding umbrella, still collapsed, on the roof. Fancy got out of Pinto, carrying her umbrella and a small bento box, with Raz close behind. She honed her cameras on a pontoon boat approaching over Lake Washington. Seeing this, Spitfire began setting up her wheelchair.

Janet asked "what brings you here? Is it crime? I like crime."

Raz and Janet got into a conversation about the legality of SINs until the boat pulled up, and the suits disembarked. A man in a straw hat asked them to jump aboardm, saying they asked the "tour company." "Step aboard..." they trailed off, noticing Spitfire in their wheelchair. "Ah, do we have a ramp, or..."

"I can handle myself."

Spitfire snapped their fingers, and their roto drone appeared to help board. Fancy offered to help, but Spitfire declined.

The Johnson pulled out some drinks. Fancy also unwrapped the bento box, carrying some sandwiches, saying they were real, not soy. Janet also offered apple oatmeal cookies. Spitfire declined all food and drink.

After getting far enough out, the Johnson pulled out a white noise generator, and said this team seemed perfect for the job, mentioning the pay was 18k, outside of Seattle, and relatively unknown but alive. Somewhere along the Pacific coast, within the old US territory.

The territory was out of the city, but no heavy guard was expected.

Janet asked if it was a lost pet, the cute cat Cinema. It didn't take long for Spitfire to figure out that they were on the job because they had a helicopter.

Feeling something was off, Spitfire negotatied a 5k damages account, if any of her drones or helicopter was damaged.

With negotiations complete, the Johnson began explaining the situation. Miss Tenaria, the wealthy owner of the show cat Cinema, was wandering in the contested zone near the Tir. They were jumped by elves near Kep'el, and Tenaria was captured. She was summarily executed, but the cat escaped North.

Janet asked Spitfire about transport, and they explained possible strategies for deployment. Spitfire took them to her compound, moving to her garage to work on finishing her oddmod.

"Oh, you just need to attach that to the motherboard... The first thing you need to do is make sure the spirits are on your side."

Janet helped with the odd mod in her own way, and with that finished they moved to the rest of the team to plan... Or rather, the team dumped it all on Spitfire to get them in without issue.

She thought through three options. Flying through the mountains was very stealthy, but ran the risk if they were spotted they would immediately be suspicous. Flying over the water was less suspicious but also provided less radar cover. Or flying in legitimately was always an option, but required a face.

Fancy mentioned she preferred wheels on the ground, and trusted Spitfire's word that they were one of the most active pilots on the hub.

With some help from Janet's spirits, the helo was flying better than ever. Too much even for Spitfire to handle. She took it easy through the canyon run, also assisted by perception altering magic, and punched it once they left the cover in a straight line to the cat's last known location.

As they returned to a speed at which normal people could perceive, the team found themselves over the location where the collar was last detected. He shoved the climbing gear to the rest of the team.

"Alright, get to work."

Fancy and Pridemane began trying to ask Raz whether he would rather be carried or shapechanged. Janet took matters into their own hands, diving out of the helicopter, while Fancy shapechanged Raz into an Eagle. Raz dove out next, nearly plummeting to the ground but managing to adjust, as Pridemane and Fancy rappelled.

Janet retrieved her spirit, but kept the concealment magic on the helicopter, until the spirit expired after searching for the spirit.

The team decided to continue on foot, and Spitfire flipped on her surface search to find a place to land. Scanning through her data, she found a couple candidate sites around where they expected  the cat and some prisoners were being held.

Janet tugged on one of the ropes, sending a DNI to Spitfire that she wanted to take a nap. Spitfire deployed the Dustoff to bring her back aboard, then landed in a nearby clearing to save fuel until the suncells started charging in the morning. She deployed her Doberman to follow the team in, setting her Agent to monitor the matrix around the helo.

Suddenly, Spitfire got a notification from their Agent:

"There are lights coming through the forest. I believe they are attempting to converge at this location."

Spitfire let off a string of curses in French, and jumped back into the helicopter, commanding the Dalmation to return. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Spitfire, Fancy had just.. stepped on a guy?

As Fancy and Pridemade dealt with the problem, Spitfire ID'ed the three jeeps approaching. Two with HMGs and one with a drone rack. Some rocket launchers. Clearly making their way to the clearing.

Spitfire spun up the blades, then jumped back into the Dalmation to get it there faster, as Janet futiley attempted to hide the helicopter with magic.

The jeeps reached the clearing, and were clearly confused at this heliopter with music playing and lights flashing. Especially since they hadn't noticed it until that point. Janet moved to the door, and someone who appeared to be the leader hopped off their jeep and began approaching.

He began grilling Janet as to why they were there. Janet tried deflecting some of the anger by implying the Californian Free State was causing problems again, but the elf still implied they wanted to sieze the helicopter for their cause. Unfortunately, the captain wasn't convinced, so Janet cast Influence while vaunting that the elves back in her day were prouder and nobler than stealing from old ladies.

This caused the enemy mage to astrally percieve, and panic, seeing Janet's power. She may have also cast a sneaky second Influence on the mage, causing him to think she was significantly more powerful than them.

With the elves gone, the team decided on a plan of attack: Spitfire wanted to fly over as a distraction, and to get cameras on the camp, while others on the team snuck in from the south. Spitfire flep up to the camp, switching to wireless off as a decker began attacking, and faking picking up the team to throw off the opfor. She flew over the north to draw attention that way, as Fancy snuck in from the South, she identified jury rigged SAM site: soviet-era missile tubes hardwired to a modern radar.

A plague of biblical proportions began to swarm the camp, as Fancy worked her magic, and Raz and Pridemane encountered one of the patrol jeeps. As they gunned the engine to chase Raz, Prideman killed the driver, spearing the driver, and sending two of the passengers flying as the jeep rolled.

Spitfire flicked her wireless back on to an AR feed of Pridemane butchering the two surviving passengers.

She evaded a missile lock from the radar system, moving to the closest landing sight. Two unguided missiles flew past, Spitfire evading gently and with ease, before landing. Janet and Spitfire discussed next steps, with Spitfire saying he wanted to geek the decker, who to riggers were basically a mage. Janet also mentioned there was a mage somewhere, suggesting they take the decker and Spitfire the mage.

Regardless, Janet sent a spirit to help Fancy capture the cat, the team reconvened and Prideman had a new toy scavenged off a jeep.

Janet began tending to Pridemane as Spitfire flicked some switches in the cockpit, then dove back into VR and took off.

"Strap your harnesses, Janet keep an eye on that spirit, and fuck deckers. We'll fly too fast for them."

She took off, evading target lock and two more SAMs.

Spitfire asked if Pridemane wanted to use their new toy, but Pridemane responded that it was too damaged, so they began flying the canyon run in reverse, as significant speed.

She flew over Lake Washington, seeing 5 figures on the boat and an Ares Roadmaster and some other cars on the water. The people in the boat, two catgirls, aimed a rifle and HMG at them, as the Johnson quickly stopped them. As Spitfire pulled up alongside, the Johnson shouted a greeting at them:

"You know there's a thing called a commcode, right?!"

Spitfire called his comm, which he answered to be able to talk over the sound of the blades.

"You should've hired a decker."

Then, Fancy held the cat like in the Lion King, stepped onto the boat and handed over the cat.

"I don't really know what to do when another team shows up during a meet, but let me get the credsticks."

Fancy received the credsticks, and the last thing they heard was "are we extracting a cat too?

"No, no, it's a bull!"

They flew back to the compound, and Spitfire got to editing as the team parted ways.

Game 1: Blowing Hard
2025-08-30
GM: legionof1
Players:
thibbledorfpwen as Avicenna, the Human "Medecker" (Mage/Decker)
littleangel/PanzerKamfWagen-727 as Svafa, the Human "FLR Viking" (Sniper/Muscle)
ArchmageAstra as Dopey, the Human "Not Exactly Complex" (Muscle)
Myself (Pon Pon) as Spitfire, the Human "Helo Rigger" (Rigger)

12 hours before the meet, they were given the location: A bar in "The Joke" in the Redmond Barrens. Unbeknownst to her, this was a Yakuza establishment, which the other gangs would steer clear of. Spitfire donned her mask.

She prepped the helo for takeoff, then hopped in her Click. She arrived early, to look for a subtle place to park.

With her Roto-Drone in tow, she entered the establishment that clearly meant business, not acknowledging the four guards with assault rifles.

The client explained the job: One that required discretion, and an "excess of violence." He needed a facility destroyed, providing explosives and compensation. He opened with an offer of 16k each. The team exchanged DNI, trying to figure out who would negotiate. Between the dope, the Frenchman, and the Decker they figured the 2m tall viking lady was their best option.

With the futile attempt to increase the pay, the client told them about the small pier, on which the buildings needing razing sat. Security would be light. He slid over a chip, looking at Spitfire and mentioning its island location. The time limit was three days, and upon prompting, offered an advance of 6k.

Asked about the explosives, one of the guards was prompted to place a duffel bag of explosives, saying it should be sufficient for both blowing the pier's supports, and a little extra for dealing with opfor.

Avicenna took the explosives, after asking and receiving a negative from the rest of the team about explosives experience. He also asked about the guard, which they were told well armed and drone patrols. The response would be as expected, as it was within territorial affilliation, though the water was NAN. The client mentioned a rapid clear of the area would be in order.

With that, Avicenna handed Dopey the bag, and they went to Svafa's house. As they left, Spitfire caught a glance on her Mercedes' cameras of a well armoured van with a hastily covered corporate logo on the back, presumably the client's vehicle.

Realizing armour may be an issue, Spitfire mentioned they could just go to the airstrip anyways, since they would need to board the helo, though they ended up at Svafa's in the end, with Dopey ducking into a bathroom to get changed.

Thibble began discussing the team's skills, getting the sinking feeling this would be a fairly brute force operation.

Spitfire thought there shouldn't be too much trouble getting in, but getting out untangled from Goat Island at the North end of Skaggett Bay would be difficult due to the relative confinement of the Sound, and the NAN's aggressive response. She mentioned that her helicopter could outrun anything similar with her piloting, but jets or SAMs would be an issue.

Avicenna did a matrix search on NAN's security, finding that it was most likely SAM sites and naval craft to be concerned with, though there was a possibility a spirit would be deployed.

Discussing the insertion, it came up that the two muscles wanted to go in stealth. However, Spitfire mentioned that helicopter engines were not exactly quiet, and it was so that neither muscle had parachuting experience.

To help with Dopey's moron antics, Avicenna cast some magic to improve Dopey's mental skills.

Spitfire mentioned that she could place her car on the bridge, though the team agreed the air was a better plan. Spitfire began planning a route to avoid the nearby airbase and its radar site.

Avicenna also handed Spitfire a sitcker of a red flash, saying it would make the helicopter faster when needed. Spitfire then helped the team gear up, with everyone wearing a parachute. Avicenna took some convincing, but once they learned it was in case the helicopter ceased to exist it didn't take much longer.

With alchemical preps handed out, Spitfire took her pills and spun up the blades.

She jumped into the Little Buddy and began sneaking the boat in. She navigated the boat politely out of the marina, and a safe distance from the island. Next, she flew the helicopter, sneaking through the radar blind spots and using the rain as cover.

Spitfire spotted 4 guards on the pier through her cameras as they approached, and six Roto-Drones. Spitfire reported the counts, and gave a T minus. Avicenna began hacking the opfor RCC. Then Spitfire popped up, and the team deployed. After Savfa took out a rocket turret, and Avicenna disabled the opfor rigger, Spitfire deployed her Doberman, jumping into it and commanding the AN-822 to maintain position and evade.

Spitfire's drones began suppressing with stick n' shock while the other two pulled chutes and continued to shoot.

One last burst from the team, and the last of the guards they could see were down. Comms went dark on the island, but Spitfire could see lights from traffic further in the island.

Svafa smashed down the door down, and the group entered the building. She brought the helicopter low, using her Dustoff to stow the chutes, then dropped lines for the team to climb.

As they took off, a target lock indicator lit up. She flipped the helicopter, as the missile went screaming by Dopey, who was still climbing up, leaving him hanging from one of the skids.

"What are you waiting for? Get in!"

As he climbed in, she spun the helicopter flat, and another missile flew past, splashing them. She whizzed past, towards the mountains, breaking line of sight among the hills as she took a lazy route around Seattle, then popping up closer to the landing strip and blending in with traffic.
