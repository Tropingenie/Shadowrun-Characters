Game 5: Rags are Riches
2025-10-19
GM: rabidanubis
Players:
drbraddock (Twelve) as Purple, Prime Runner Super Spy
penny42 as Euclase, Technomancer
myself (_ponpon) as Spitfire

with guest appearances:
 - foreverjester as The Black Witch, Magical Girl
 - blt6409 as Jack Daniels, Face with a Glue Bomb

Spitfire's chronic pain was flaring up that month. She woke up in a drek mood, but powered through. She also didn't know it, but she was distinctly the newest runner on the team. After a morning in pain, trying to distract herself through her drones, she got a message from Tlaloc at arount 11 a.m. to meet in an hour on a street corner in May Creek. She pulled the car into her living hangar, preparing to go.

She received a DNI from Euclase as she rolled up to a Hyundai Equus waiting with its door open. With some help from her roto, the got out of her Mercedes, and got in the Hyundai.

There was a hitch as a gridguide routine took over, and the front seats spun around to reveal a girl dressed as a vampire.

"Grr! Happy Halloween!"

The team quickly confirmed she wasn't an actual vampire, and though Spitfire didn't recognize her, this was the Johnson known as "Akuma," somewhat new, trustworthy, but also a playful type reputed for creative jobs. She described a company, "ScarySafe." The name rung a bell, but Spitfire's work was really in high fashion, not armoured costumes, so her knowledge wasn't much help. Akuma and Purple began discussing the company, and how she liked their work. A "person" was going to buy out the company, and her client wanted to know why the buyout was happening, and to grab a costume sample or whatever was being handed off.

    - 6k each to grab a sample of the product or whatever makes them want to buy it
    - 3k each find out why this person wants to purchase the company
    - Secondary job once information in hand

The team was dissatisfied with the base pay, so negotated better pay while Euclase and Spitfire discussed infiltration options. She gave a double or nothing offer of 10k each, and mentioned an expense account of 5k. Purple said 10k or the team walks, and she folded.

Once a deal was made, she mentioned that Ares were the company taking interest, and the company was in Covington, Auburn. She mentioned a dinner party to celebrate the acquisition, and that the job needed to be done quickly. Danny Hart, an elf, was the negotiator, and would bring personal security--she explicitly mentioned to not do anything bad to him so as to not start a war with Ares. She also handed over a datachip with her dossier.

After the negotiations, all Spitfire mentioned was to "not expect him to move any heavy equipment."

Euclase did the Joker gun hand, the team discussed the poor pay, and Spitfire's Mercedes pulled up. As they drove around, Purple figured their best option was to hit the Host and have Spitfire send in a drone to physically scout. As they drove to the HQ, Euclase began hitting the host.

Euclase informed the team she was under attack, and Spitfire dropped into VR to assist, though her skills were poor enough that the "help" was unwelcome. She eventually realized this, opting to jack out and focus on driving as more hackers poured in, fueled by their desire to meet a celebrity.

Spitfire reached over to reboot Euclase's comm, and Euclase slapped his hand away.

"Just get out of there, there's too many of them... Tabarnac... There's gonna be increased security."

Euclase then informed the team that she had been traced; Spitfire stepped on it, changing their course then taking off down an alley. As they rounded the corner, Spitfire caught a drone on her camera. Then two. Then, she heard helicopter blades, recognizing a civilian audio signature, likely a news helicopter.

Purple plugged in to a data port, letting Spitfire know that he and Euclase wanted to be let off at the nearest corner. He obliged. Euclase asked to be dropped off in Tukwila, Downtown. Spitfire obliged.

With the team gone, Spitfire picked up a commcall to her fixer, Tlaloc.

"How soon can you get a team off the Hub?"

Tlaloc arranged, getting Boomslang, TBW, and Jack Daniels in the car. Pulling out her white noise generator, she descibed to the team the details of the job. They agreed, so Spitfire drove and began scouting with her Fly Spy. It seemed there was no increased alert; everyone was dressed in costume for the Halloween party at the Halloween company. Pizza and drinks were already open.

Spitfire also spotted, on nearby roofs, someone hard to see--a sniper with an RPC. Four snipers, a few micro drones, all keeping their eyes on the facility. There was also a suspicious unmarked van.

The team began investigating for blind spots, noting that the only blind spot of this Ares security team was inside the building.

The team began discussing the approach. TBW suggested they approach as Wuxing, asking about the acquisition. Boomslang also mentioned they could approach as a nearby Wuxing factory's rep asking about the recent matrix hit.

Spitfire also suggested two ways to get people in: Either fly the helicopter over, and hope one or more of the snipers would look at it, and TBW and Jack Daniels could invite themselves to the party under their Wuxing cover.

As TBW acquired Wuxing SINs, Spitfire scouted inside with her Fly Spy. Searching for the costume in question, she noticed a new type of armoured fabric in one of the outfits being put in a box. They noted the serial number on the box, and its label.

The team confirmed the details: Grab that costume, and the socials left to join the party, and hopefully get Danny drunk.

TBW and Jack Daniels approached the building from a different direction. Spitfire watched them enter, and Jack Daniels went for a complementary costume. In the meantime, they discussed if they wanted to just grab the box. Boomslang noticed one of the snipers shift a little, prompting Spitfire to check for marks, but not finding anything. Boomslang slaved his Noizeqsquito to Spitfire's RCC to give her a look, but also couldn't make out what was agitating the sniper.

TBW began conversing with a similarly costume factory worker, who told them about their advances in price point and generally their technology. The worker seemed willing to talk, but also unsure what they could share. She began pressing, saying she might be interested in the product, but pressed too far and the worker got suspicious.

Jack Daniels intercepted, and managed to distract her from reporting to the higher ups, and started getting a tour from her. She began telling him about the types of fabrics corresponding to tapes. He asked about the white tape, that was on the box they were interested in, which got her talking about the new material. Jack played himself as a new materials scientist, so she introduced him to Joe who could better explain the new material.

Despite another guy saying they shouldn't talk about it, Joe explained the new material: It was a one-time, super strong protection for stopping one bullet really well, following the principles of ablative armour. He gave a deeply technical conversation about a non-Newtonian fabric through Spitfire feeding him various terms from her experience with fashion armour. Joe only talked about the application to Halloween costumes, and Jack prodded him about other applications, causing Joe's face to assume an interesting expression as he realized what he had invented.

Spitfire sent a transcript of what was said to Akuma immediately, as Joe tried to cut Jack in on a deal: Steal some boxes.

Akuma got back to them, offering 6k to destroy the material, and another 6k to bring Joe back with them. Joe did all the diversionary work for them, and Jack helped load a car. They drove away, but the white van was tailing them.

Meanwhile, TBW turned invisible and pulled the fire alarm. Spitfire flew with the full Docwagon procedure for flying in as a preemptive response for a company with a contract. Then a sniper round smashed through the drone.

TBW said "I got the drone, don't worry" over DNI, then went off comms.

Meanwhile, Jack threw a glue bomb, catching it in the axles of the van causing it to flip.

Splitfire then went sicko mode. Over the PA, she screamed curses in French" Mon tabarnak j'vais te décâlisser la yeule, câlice!" Stick and shock flying everywhere, mag dumping the gun. Three of the four snipers went down as bullets flew everywhere, and Boomslang took out the fourth with his AK.

Meanwhile, TBW used magic to get the broken Dustoff out, and threw it in the car. Spitfire peeled away, meeting up with Jack and Joe. Boomslang helped move the boxes of costumes into his car, while Spitfire rebooted and went over everything with a tag eraser.

They met up with Akuma, who was a little confused at the extra runners, especially given the prime runners.

"Prime runners just aren't what they used to be." was Spitfire's excuse, which Akemi took and agreed with.

Game 4: [CSR] You Can Lead a Boat to water
2025-10-04
GM: swimmer117
Players:
Angel (littleangel) as Svafa the Human Cyber Viking Muscle
Penne (penny42) as Euclase the Human Technomancer
Defective_Gh0st as Keen the Human Investigator Mage

The morning of, IIb was preparing her helo and drones for the job. Low on SNS, she loaded a magazine with APDS for her roto, then moved to wiring the Blight grenade Tlaloc had recommended her to have in case of spirits. It still wasn't quite the level of a professional Coyote, but the turret could come later.

The team rolled up, and 2b tried to make a quick escape to get her mask on, but Svafa caught her and lifted her out of the wheelchair in a bear hug. Spitfire had to quickly activate her voice changer, totally concealing her feminine voice from the rest of the team.

"Yeah, we totally got that is your real voice..." sniped Euclase.

Spitfire lead them to a secure trid room, and slotted the holodisk he had from Tlaloc. He spoke of a Nightrunner that had been recently confiscated by CFS authorities, and was being held in a facility near the PCC border. The location was near Marycopa. Tlaloc would help with the insertion.

The team discussed some basics with Spitfire's limited knowledge, and they agreed to the contract. He pulled out the second data disk and tossed the data disk at Euclase, who was closest to the trid projector. It bounced off her chest, since her hands were in her pockets, so Spitfire flew a drone over to insert it.

This second disk gave them the exact impound lot/station/barracks of the Californian Rangers, southwest of Bakersfield. Around 10 rangers could be expected. The boat had been picked up at an abandoned pier north of Faria Beach, jsut off the 101. Another contact's commcode was provided, to tell them more about the boat itself, and a warning of the CFS/PCC tension.

Spitfire thought back to the comm call he had with Tlaloc to see if there was any other relevant information for the team that had been left out of the two disks. The urgency in his voice came to mind, and Spitfire suspected higher ups were pressuring him, and told the team about the time limit.

He began pre-flight checks, and the team boarded. Svafa gave a very abbreviated explanation of the parachutes at Spitfire's request, and Euclase plugged into an exposed data port to get her machine sprite. Spitfire submitted her flight plan to Tlaloc, which he managed to get through.

Tlaloc also gave Spitfire the locations of some stops along the way for refueling, as the weather wouldn't be playing nice causing a single tank to not last the entire flight. Two were in the Tir, which the team figured wasn't the best place to land with a helicopter full of humans, and so opted for the base near Eureka.

She flew them out of Seattle, into international waters, and turned south towards Cali Free State. Turning in near the contested zone between the Tir and CFS, Spitfire spotted an active border skirmish over the water. Drones were dogfighting in the air, as coast guard-style craft fired deck guns at each other. The craft flying Tir colours had the upper hand. Meanwhile, the burnt-out coastal town on the shore had ground combat, flashes of gunfire and artillery making their way south as the CFS were pushed out.

Keen, at Euclase's request, rightly cast invisibility, as more vessels joined the fight. Svafa noticed that Keen had gone pale, and asked him what he saw. He described to the team a great magic mountain to the east, watching them.

Spitfire landed at the base northeast of Eureka, in Blue Lake. Because of the border tensions, the town was completely abandoned. She buttered the bread on the landing zone Tlaloc had marked, near an old brewery and transportation yard. The nearby shed opened, and drones emerged to pull the helo into the shed.

In the meantime, Euclase finished her matrix search, giving the team info on their target.

"So, team? How do we want to do this?"

"Well, I fly over, shoot rockets, we grab the boat, and leave."

"...so we go loud?"

"...is what I would do if I had rockets. Instead, that's why I have you all."

As they flew over, Euclase began cracking the host to try and gather more intel. Spitfire asked about potential landing sites, while Keen wondered about camera placement and response times. She entered the host.

"Wow, they styled it like an old saloon. Where do you think the landing logs would be stored? The saloon?"

"Mayor's office?"

After some hits, and a couple breaks, Euclase got into a file that let them make note that the rangers had sold the boat as surplus to the State of Seattle, and Keen would be picking it up on Seattle's behalf. The team began discussing how to transport the boat to the water, with Spitfire ruling out just airlifting it immediately due to the size difference.

Instead, she called Flore Carras, the contact in California Tlaloc had given them a commcode for. There was a brief attack on his Meta Link, which Spitfire resisted, then received a call from the number. Spitfire answered to a tirade of Aztlaner Spanish. Asking for a vehicle, she mentioned a slight problem: She was on the wrong side of the border.

Keen took over negotiations from there, seeing as Spitfire's bluntness was never going to get through. With Svafa translating, he managed to strike a deal: Save Flore's friend, Acosador.

"I'll do it for you, but I'm sticking my neck out crossing the border again! So you better get him out. You understand, gringo?!"

They agreed to the deal, deciding to get the boat out first, then rescue Acosador. Flore agreed to meet them just across the border, on the Cali Free side. Keen got the keys, and Flore pulled him close, reminding him of the deal. Spitfire handed Keen her roto to put in the back, just in case, and he was off.

Spitfire, jumped into the Roto, and Keen pulled up to the Rangers facility, seeing their flag, and a couple sports cars, at around 8 p.m. The two rangers out front played ro-sham-bo, and the loser walked up to the truck, grabbing his hat off the car and gesturing for Keen to roll down the window, hopping on the running board.

"Evening. We're closed up for the night."

"I'm here to pick up a boat. If you just let me get that hooked up, I'll be out of your hair."

The ranger got a chirp on his comm.

"Victor Wu, then..."

He scanned Keen's SIN, gave him a long once-over. Keen blinked first, and the ranger asked him to step outside.

"Officer, I understand it's very late. If you see that everything's in order, let's move things along quickly."

The ranger glanced at the SIN scanner, which came up as a match.

"All right then, Mr. Wu. Why don't you come on in."

The truck entered the impound lot, an Victor "activated" the roto to begin helping hook up the trailer. They rolled past a few vehicles: More two seater cruisers, muscle cars with machine guns sticking out of the hood, then into the impound lot proper which had around a hundred vehicles, everything from Jackrabbits and Harleys to GMC Step Vans and a MACK Hellhound.

A pair of orc rangers were on hand to observe the transfer, and spot the trailer. Spitfire took off to help hook up the hitch as Keen controlled the pickup truck's autopilot to back it up. They got the boat out without too much trouble.

As they exited the facility, they saw an unmarked black step van, with a prisoner being transported by another two rangers.

"Soo... What are the odds that that's the guy?"

At that moment, a message came over DNI from Euclase:

"Comms compromized."

At that point, the ranger who was with Keen pulled a gun, citing suspicion with the drone. Keen deflected, saying that it was just given to him by his employer, and they would need to bring any issues up with the Seattle government.

Spitfire began rapidly rebooting everything slaved to her RCC, as Svafa shot down the drone, then shot a round through the cab of Keen's truck. The fire fight continued, and four engines roared around the rear of the compound.

Spitfire gave up on rebooting, launching their drone and mag dumping one of the rangers who were beating on Acosador. As the truck pulled away, Acosador made a break for it, diving into the back, and Spitfire landed her drone next to him before jumping back into her helo.

He told his agent to start analyzing threats as he switched his RCC wireless off, and began dodging the incoming hail of bullets from the rangers' HMGs. Svafa dove for cover as a hail pinged off the armour, while Euclase leveraged her reputation and access to their host to negotiate them to back down.

Acosador made his way into the cab of the truck, and after some tense negotiations involving a gun, he told Keen about a better location to launch the boat from.

Despite his best efforts, bullets pierced the armour of the helo, shocking Spitfire to her core as she was hit by biofeedback for the first time. Still, the rangers backed down, and they made their extraction, taking Acosador to Seattle with them in the boat.

Only Svafa and Acosudor on the boat. He asked to be dropped off at the Aztechnology Pyramid, making a call near arrival. When they arrived, he handing off some sort of hydroponic plant to a group of bodyguards and execs.

When Spitfire got there, he took a long look at the pyramid.

"It was only the boat."

Game 3: Going Fishing
2025-09-18
GM: legionof1
Players:
Fancy as Autumn the PhysAd Centaur Muscle
Bleu as Hellebore, the Techno Hacker/Face
peterr4411 (CoolCatPete) as Dancer, the Elf Mage
Myself (Pon Pon) as Spitfire, the Helo Rigger

The meet was at a specific set of coordinates, near the eastern edge of the Redmond barrens. A brief search found that the location was a bare hilltop, perfect for a landing. Near the southern end of the Skykomish river where it leaves Seattle.

Rolling out of bed as her comm rang, she took her psyche, prepped her helo, and took off, making sure to don his mask before jumping in, and flying into the sunset.

As she approached, in her sensors he detected a person standing at the top of the hill next to a well used firepit, and a woman in nun's uniform at the base. The nun began walking up hill, greeting the elderly human male at the campfire. Next, a panel van pulled up, and a centaur in a sweatshirt climbed out, and finally an elf Technomancer riding in a Noizesquito drone.

The elderly man looked over the team, and at Spitfire's helo. "Only three?"

This prompted Hellebore to introduce themself through the Noizquito speakers.

"Ah, four then."

The man explained the job: A small town in the mountains, where something lent was lost due to the lendee dying. Spitfire, having spooled down the engine, cracked a door to listen.

Hellebore began negotiaton, asking about the cargo, which turned out to be full sized statues, made of mundane stone. Each statue was to pay out 12000, with bonuses. At dancer's question, it came out that a year and a day had passed since the lendee's death, for next of kin to claim them. Autumn dragged out that the local government likely claimed the property. And Hellebore asked why runners were necessary, to which he responded that he couldn't leave Seattle due to "other promises."

Hellebore asked about the bonuses, to which they were offered another 3k for the spellbooks, and another 3k for a special knife. Both of which likely attractive to mundane thieves.

Hellebore asked Spitfire's typical rate, which they truthfully answered around 20k nuyen. This got the Johnson up to that number, and the team agreed to the job.

4 statues, faces of four men he once knew. The old man took out a paper photograph depicting the men around a campfire, so they knew what the statues looked like. He also described the spellbook, showing them a sketch, and the blade, which was silver with a ruby in the pommel. At time of death, they would have all been in the home at Snoos Junction.

He described the small town in the mountains, about 25 miles Southeast of their current location, within Salish council territory.

With the team's silence, the old man bid them farewell, giving them a comm code at Hellebore's request before he left.

Hellebore send a location near the I-90, which Spitfire dispatched a car to. He also explained that there was only room for the team or the statues, not both.

Spitfire's Click picked up Hellebore, and as they drew near, her drone took off to meet up. Hellebore greeted the team.

Spitfire explained their usual method, but the brute force flying under the radar he didn't want to do in case they got spotted, and pursued. He racked his brain about methods to "legally illegally" cross the border. Flying at tree height the entire way after Tiger Mountain, as long as they got past the border it would be possible to get quite close without being noticed.

At egging by Hellebore, Spitfire mentioned they could call a contact of theirs, and phoned Tlaloc. Explaining their crossing, Tlaloc said it would be easy enough to grease a few palms, and get them some steel cable, to be picked up in a Lowe's. Spitfire called in a favour with him, and he gave them a window of about a day.

It took them a few hours to retrieve the net. Hellebore asked what the others did for a living, guessing incorrectly that Spitfire was a smuggler. Dancer explained their quest, as a nun from India, leading others to enligtenment. Autumn was in Seattle from Greece, on a job.

Dancer left on the astral, finding a six-eyed creature on the astral in the house, and returning to share this information as Spitfire finished gearing the cargo net for takeoff.

Hellebore did their matrix magic, blessing the helicopter. Spitfire took it to be wizard shit again, despite it being perfectly mundane this time.

They flew their canyon run, pinging a landing site with surface search radar and landing a few km away.

The team disembarked, and Dancer summoned an Air spirit. Hellebore handed her a data tap, while Spitfire passed over their Fly Spy, then began deploying their larger drones.

The away team, consisting of Dancer and Autumn, made their way into town, and Spitfire hid their drones near town. Near the house, Dancer deployed the Fly Spy, which quickly located a hole with which it could enter. The house was a 5 room, 1 floor, with kitchen, bathroom, dining room, and enclosed porch.

The statues were on the feed in the enclosed porch. Spitfire suggested he could begin looking for the knife as the rest of the team secured the statues.

Dancer walked up to the door of the porch, and yanked it open. Then a spider spirit manifested behind the away team.

Dancer gave it a bow, greeting it formally. It introduced itself as "Chippers," asking why the team was attempting to enter the house. Dancer explained the situation, confirming with Chippers that an old man asked them to recover the statues, book, and knife. Chippers also explained he had his own deal with the late owner, that the contents of the house were theirs. Dancer and Chipper negotiated a deal: They retrieve the goods, and help Chippers with something they sought: The removal of the mortals in the town, making it "spider's place alone."

The away team retreated slightly, and Hellebore asked "why don't you just splatter him?" Dancer was hesitant to do so, instead asking Hellebore to spoof an emergency radio broadcast, warning of flash floods. Hellebore located the emergency receiver and began the hack, while Dancer prepared to summon a new spirit and sell the lie with some physical effects.

Autumn brought up that the spider's wording potentially meant the team would have to leave. Dancer relayed this to the team, but the team concluded Spitfire's drones could likely handle it.

Finishing the hack, and with Dancer's spirit manipulating the weather, the town quickly burst to life, with the East road filling with traffic.

The spider then rolled everything into the stream. Spitfire flew the helicopter over, and Autumn loaded the statues. On her cameras, Spitfire watched the flooding continue, stopping and circling around the town as a wall of water. Through the wall, Spitfire could see webbing creeping up the buildings.

As they approached Seattle, Hellebore contacted the Johnson, and he met them at the hill. Once the statues were unloaded, he handed over a credstick, then him, the box, and all four statues vanished.

Spitfire offered to fly the team home, and each was ferried to their location of choice.

Game 2: Absolute Cinema
2025-09-11
GM: Rodeo (rabidanubis)
Players:
LateStagePythagorean (fragrantvagrant) as Janet the Support Mage
SliMesi as Pridemane the Beast Adept
fancyrat as Fancy the Shape-changer Adept Wheelman
Myself (Pon Pon) as Spitfire

Spitfire hadn't gotten as much work done on preparing the helo as she wanted, but had moved on to trying to figure out how their RCC work. A call from Tlaloc came in, notifying them of a job.

Still distracted, they made their way to the meeting location, a once nice beach on the peninsula in Laurelhurst: The Laurelhurst Beach Club. Nobody else was around, and it wasn't long before Spitfire saw "Pinto," Fancy's Shin-Hyung, and a modified, magical self-driving bicycle appeared as 9 p.m. rolled around.

Spitfire rolled down the window, placing a folding umbrella, still collapsed, on the roof. Fancy got out of Pinto, carrying her umbrella and a small bento box, with Raz close behind. She honed her cameras on a pontoon boat approaching over Lake Washington. Seeing this, Spitfire began setting up her wheelchair.

Janet asked "what brings you here? Is it crime? I like crime."

Raz and Janet got into a conversation about the legality of SINs until the boat pulled up, and the suits disembarked. A man in a straw hat asked them to jump aboardm, saying they asked the "tour company." "Step aboard..." they trailed off, noticing Spitfire in their wheelchair. "Ah, do we have a ramp, or..."

"I can handle myself."

Spitfire snapped their fingers, and their roto drone appeared to help board. Fancy offered to help, but Spitfire declined.

The Johnson pulled out some drinks. Fancy also unwrapped the bento box, carrying some sandwiches, saying they were real, not soy. Janet also offered apple oatmeal cookies. Spitfire declined all food and drink.

After getting far enough out, the Johnson pulled out a white noise generator, and said this team seemed perfect for the job, mentioning the pay was 18k, outside of Seattle, and relatively unknown but alive. Somewhere along the Pacific coast, within the old US territory.

The territory was out of the city, but no heavy guard was expected.

Janet asked if it was a lost pet, the cute cat Cinema. It didn't take long for Spitfire to figure out that they were on the job because they had a helicopter.

Feeling something was off, Spitfire negotatied a 5k damages account, if any of her drones or helicopter was damaged.

With negotiations complete, the Johnson began explaining the situation. Miss Tenaria, the wealthy owner of the show cat Cinema, was wandering in the contested zone near the Tir. They were jumped by elves near Kep'el, and Tenaria was captured. She was summarily executed, but the cat escaped North.

Janet asked Spitfire about transport, and they explained possible strategies for deployment. Spitfire took them to her compound, moving to her garage to work on finishing her oddmod.

"Oh, you just need to attach that to the motherboard... The first thing you need to do is make sure the spirits are on your side."

Janet helped with the odd mod in her own way, and with that finished they moved to the rest of the team to plan... Or rather, the team dumped it all on Spitfire to get them in without issue.

She thought through three options. Flying through the mountains was very stealthy, but ran the risk if they were spotted they would immediately be suspicous. Flying over the water was less suspicious but also provided less radar cover. Or flying in legitimately was always an option, but required a face.

Fancy mentioned she preferred wheels on the ground, and trusted Spitfire's word that they were one of the most active pilots on the hub.

With some help from Janet's spirits, the helo was flying better than ever. Too much even for Spitfire to handle. She took it easy through the canyon run, also assisted by perception altering magic, and punched it once they left the cover in a straight line to the cat's last known location.

As they returned to a speed at which normal people could perceive, the team found themselves over the location where the collar was last detected. He shoved the climbing gear to the rest of the team.

"Alright, get to work."

Fancy and Pridemane began trying to ask Raz whether he would rather be carried or shapechanged. Janet took matters into their own hands, diving out of the helicopter, while Fancy shapechanged Raz into an Eagle. Raz dove out next, nearly plummeting to the ground but managing to adjust, as Pridemane and Fancy rappelled.

Janet retrieved her spirit, but kept the concealment magic on the helicopter, until the spirit expired after searching for the spirit.

The team decided to continue on foot, and Spitfire flipped on her surface search to find a place to land. Scanning through her data, she found a couple candidate sites around where they expected  the cat and some prisoners were being held.

Janet tugged on one of the ropes, sending a DNI to Spitfire that she wanted to take a nap. Spitfire deployed the Dustoff to bring her back aboard, then landed in a nearby clearing to save fuel until the suncells started charging in the morning. She deployed her Doberman to follow the team in, setting her Agent to monitor the matrix around the helo.

Suddenly, Spitfire got a notification from their Agent:

"There are lights coming through the forest. I believe they are attempting to converge at this location."

Spitfire let off a string of curses in French, and jumped back into the helicopter, commanding the Dalmation to return. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Spitfire, Fancy had just.. stepped on a guy?

As Fancy and Pridemade dealt with the problem, Spitfire ID'ed the three jeeps approaching. Two with HMGs and one with a drone rack. Some rocket launchers. Clearly making their way to the clearing.

Spitfire spun up the blades, then jumped back into the Dalmation to get it there faster, as Janet futiley attempted to hide the helicopter with magic.

The jeeps reached the clearing, and were clearly confused at this heliopter with music playing and lights flashing. Especially since they hadn't noticed it until that point. Janet moved to the door, and someone who appeared to be the leader hopped off their jeep and began approaching.

He began grilling Janet as to why they were there. Janet tried deflecting some of the anger by implying the Californian Free State was causing problems again, but the elf still implied they wanted to sieze the helicopter for their cause. Unfortunately, the captain wasn't convinced, so Janet cast Influence while vaunting that the elves back in her day were prouder and nobler than stealing from old ladies.

This caused the enemy mage to astrally percieve, and panic, seeing Janet's power. She may have also cast a sneaky second Influence on the mage, causing him to think she was significantly more powerful than them.

With the elves gone, the team decided on a plan of attack: Spitfire wanted to fly over as a distraction, and to get cameras on the camp, while others on the team snuck in from the south. Spitfire flep up to the camp, switching to wireless off as a decker began attacking, and faking picking up the team to throw off the opfor. She flew over the north to draw attention that way, as Fancy snuck in from the South, she identified jury rigged SAM site: soviet-era missile tubes hardwired to a modern radar.

A plague of biblical proportions began to swarm the camp, as Fancy worked her magic, and Raz and Pridemane encountered one of the patrol jeeps. As they gunned the engine to chase Raz, Prideman killed the driver, spearing the driver, and sending two of the passengers flying as the jeep rolled.

Spitfire flicked her wireless back on to an AR feed of Pridemane butchering the two surviving passengers.

She evaded a missile lock from the radar system, moving to the closest landing sight. Two unguided missiles flew past, Spitfire evading gently and with ease, before landing. Janet and Spitfire discussed next steps, with Spitfire saying he wanted to geek the decker, who to riggers were basically a mage. Janet also mentioned there was a mage somewhere, suggesting they take the decker and Spitfire the mage.

Regardless, Janet sent a spirit to help Fancy capture the cat, the team reconvened and Prideman had a new toy scavenged off a jeep.

Janet began tending to Pridemane as Spitfire flicked some switches in the cockpit, then dove back into VR and took off.

"Strap your harnesses, Janet keep an eye on that spirit, and fuck deckers. We'll fly too fast for them."

She took off, evading target lock and two more SAMs.

Spitfire asked if Pridemane wanted to use their new toy, but Pridemane responded that it was too damaged, so they began flying the canyon run in reverse, as significant speed.

She flew over Lake Washington, seeing 5 figures on the boat and an Ares Roadmaster and some other cars on the water. The people in the boat, two catgirls, aimed a rifle and HMG at them, as the Johnson quickly stopped them. As Spitfire pulled up alongside, the Johnson shouted a greeting at them:

"You know there's a thing called a commcode, right?!"

Spitfire called his comm, which he answered to be able to talk over the sound of the blades.

"You should've hired a decker."

Then, Fancy held the cat like in the Lion King, stepped onto the boat and handed over the cat.

"I don't really know what to do when another team shows up during a meet, but let me get the credsticks."

Fancy received the credsticks, and the last thing they heard was "are we extracting a cat too?

"No, no, it's a bull!"

They flew back to the compound, and Spitfire got to editing as the team parted ways.

Game 1: Blowing Hard
2025-08-30
GM: legionof1
Players:
thibbledorfpwen as Avicenna, the Human "Medecker" (Mage/Decker)
littleangel/PanzerKamfWagen-727 as Svafa, the Human "FLR Viking" (Sniper/Muscle)
ArchmageAstra as Dopey, the Human "Not Exactly Complex" (Muscle)
Myself (Pon Pon) as Spitfire, the Human "Helo Rigger" (Rigger)

12 hours before the meet, they were given the location: A bar in "The Joke" in the Redmond Barrens. Unbeknownst to her, this was a Yakuza establishment, which the other gangs would steer clear of. Spitfire donned her mask.

She prepped the helo for takeoff, then hopped in her Click. She arrived early, to look for a subtle place to park.

With her Roto-Drone in tow, she entered the establishment that clearly meant business, not acknowledging the four guards with assault rifles.

The client explained the job: One that required discretion, and an "excess of violence." He needed a facility destroyed, providing explosives and compensation. He opened with an offer of 16k each. The team exchanged DNI, trying to figure out who would negotiate. Between the dope, the Frenchman, and the Decker they figured the 2m tall viking lady was their best option.

With the futile attempt to increase the pay, the client told them about the small pier, on which the buildings needing razing sat. Security would be light. He slid over a chip, looking at Spitfire and mentioning its island location. The time limit was three days, and upon prompting, offered an advance of 6k.

Asked about the explosives, one of the guards was prompted to place a duffel bag of explosives, saying it should be sufficient for both blowing the pier's supports, and a little extra for dealing with opfor.

Avicenna took the explosives, after asking and receiving a negative from the rest of the team about explosives experience. He also asked about the guard, which they were told well armed and drone patrols. The response would be as expected, as it was within territorial affilliation, though the water was NAN. The client mentioned a rapid clear of the area would be in order.

With that, Avicenna handed Dopey the bag, and they went to Svafa's house. As they left, Spitfire caught a glance on her Mercedes' cameras of a well armoured van with a hastily covered corporate logo on the back, presumably the client's vehicle.

Realizing armour may be an issue, Spitfire mentioned they could just go to the airstrip anyways, since they would need to board the helo, though they ended up at Svafa's in the end, with Dopey ducking into a bathroom to get changed.

Thibble began discussing the team's skills, getting the sinking feeling this would be a fairly brute force operation.

Spitfire thought there shouldn't be too much trouble getting in, but getting out untangled from Goat Island at the North end of Skaggett Bay would be difficult due to the relative confinement of the Sound, and the NAN's aggressive response. She mentioned that her helicopter could outrun anything similar with her piloting, but jets or SAMs would be an issue.

Avicenna did a matrix search on NAN's security, finding that it was most likely SAM sites and naval craft to be concerned with, though there was a possibility a spirit would be deployed.

Discussing the insertion, it came up that the two muscles wanted to go in stealth. However, Spitfire mentioned that helicopter engines were not exactly quiet, and it was so that neither muscle had parachuting experience.

To help with Dopey's moron antics, Avicenna cast some magic to improve Dopey's mental skills.

Spitfire mentioned that she could place her car on the bridge, though the team agreed the air was a better plan. Spitfire began planning a route to avoid the nearby airbase and its radar site.

Avicenna also handed Spitfire a sitcker of a red flash, saying it would make the helicopter faster when needed. Spitfire then helped the team gear up, with everyone wearing a parachute. Avicenna took some convincing, but once they learned it was in case the helicopter ceased to exist it didn't take much longer.

With alchemical preps handed out, Spitfire took her pills and spun up the blades.

She jumped into the Little Buddy and began sneaking the boat in. She navigated the boat politely out of the marina, and a safe distance from the island. Next, she flew the helicopter, sneaking through the radar blind spots and using the rain as cover.

Spitfire spotted 4 guards on the pier through her cameras as they approached, and six Roto-Drones. Spitfire reported the counts, and gave a T minus. Avicenna began hacking the opfor RCC. Then Spitfire popped up, and the team deployed. After Savfa took out a rocket turret, and Avicenna disabled the opfor rigger, Spitfire deployed her Doberman, jumping into it and commanding the AN-822 to maintain position and evade.

Spitfire's drones began suppressing with stick n' shock while the other two pulled chutes and continued to shoot.

One last burst from the team, and the last of the guards they could see were down. Comms went dark on the island, but Spitfire could see lights from traffic further in the island.

Svafa smashed down the door down, and the group entered the building. She brought the helicopter low, using her Dustoff to stow the chutes, then dropped lines for the team to climb.

As they took off, a target lock indicator lit up. She flipped the helicopter, as the missile went screaming by Dopey, who was still climbing up, leaving him hanging from one of the skids.

"What are you waiting for? Get in!"

As he climbed in, she spun the helicopter flat, and another missile flew past, splashing them. She whizzed past, towards the mountains, breaking line of sight among the hills as she took a lazy route around Seattle, then popping up closer to the landing strip and blending in with traffic.
