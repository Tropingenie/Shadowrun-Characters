12 hours before the meet, they were given the location: A bar in "The Joke" in the Redmond Barrens. Unbeknownst to her, this was a Yakuza establishment, which the other gangs would steer clear of. Spitfire donned her mask.

She prepped the helo for takeoff, then hopped in her Click. She arrived early, to look for a subtle place to park.

With her Roto-Drone in tow, she entered the establishment that clearly meant business, not acknowledging the four guards with assault rifles.

The client explained the job: One that required discretion, and an "excess of violence." He needed a facility destroyed, providing explosives and compensation. He opened with an offer of 16k each. The team exchanged DNI, trying to figure out who would negotiate. Between the dope, the Frenchman, and the Decker they figured the 2m tall viking lady was their best option.

With the futile attempt to increase the pay, the client told them about the small pier, on which the buildings needing razing sat. Security would be light. He slid over a chip, looking at Spitfire and mentioning its island location. The time limit was three days, and upon prompting, offered an advance of 6k.

Asked about the explosives, one of the guards was prompted to place a duffel bag of explosives, saying it should be sufficient for both blowing the pier's supports, and a little extra for dealing with opfor.

Avicenna took the explosives, after asking and receiving a negative from the rest of the team about explosives experience. He also asked about the guard, which they were told well armed and drone patrols. The response would be as expected, as it was within territorial affilliation, though the water was NAN. The client mentioned a rapid clear of the area would be in order.

With that, Avicenna handed Dopey the bag, and they went to Svafa's house. As they left, Spitfire caught a glance on her Mercedes' cameras of a well armoured van with a hastily covered corporate logo on the back, presumably the client's vehicle.

Realizing armour may be an issue, Spitfire mentioned they could just go to the airstrip anyways, since they would need to board the helo, though they ended up at Svafa's in the end, with Dopey ducking into a bathroom to get changed.

Thibble began discussing the team's skills, getting the sinking feeling this would be a fairly brute force operation.

Spitfire thought there shouldn't be too much trouble getting in, but getting out untangled from Goat Island at the North end of Skaggett Bay would be difficult due to the relative confinement of the Sound, and the NAN's aggressive response. She mentioned that her helicopter could outrun anything similar with her piloting, but jets or SAMs would be an issue.

Avicenna did a matrix search on NAN's security, finding that it was most likely SAM sites and naval craft to be concerned with, though there was a possibility a spirit would be deployed.

Discussing the insertion, it came up that the two muscles wanted to go in stealth. However, Spitfire mentioned that helicopter engines were not exactly quiet, and it was so that neither muscle had parachuting experience.

To help with Dopey's moron antics, Avicenna cast some magic to improve Dopey's mental skills.

Spitfire mentioned that she could place her car on the bridge, though the team agreed the air was a better plan. Spitfire began planning a route to avoid the nearby airbase and its radar site.

Avicenna also handed Spitfire a sitcker of a red flash, saying it would make the helicopter faster when needed. Spitfire then helped the team gear up, with everyone wearing a parachute. Avicenna took some convincing, but once they learned it was in case the helicopter ceased to exist it didn't take much longer.

With alchemical preps handed out, Spitfire took her pills and spun up the blades.

She jumped into the Little Buddy and began sneaking the boat in. She navigated the boat politely out of the marina, and a safe distance from the island. Next, she flew the helicopter, sneaking through the radar blind spots and using the rain as cover.

Spitfire spotted 4 guards on the pier through her cameras as they approached, and six Roto-Drones. Spitfire reported the counts, and gave a T minus. Avicenna began hacking the opfor RCC. Then Spitfire popped up, and the team deployed. After Savfa took out a rocket turret, and Avicenna disabled the opfor rigger, Spitfire deployed her Doberman, jumping into it and commanding the AN-822 to maintain position and evade.

Spitfire's drones began suppressing with stick n' shock while the other two pulled chutes and continued to shoot.

One last burst from the team, and the last of the guards they could see were down. Comms went dark on the island, but Spitfire could see lights from traffic further in the island.

Svafa smashed down the door down, and the group entered the building. She brought the helicopter low, using her Dustoff to stow the chutes, then dropped lines for the team to climb.

As they took off, a target lock indicator lit up. She flipped the helicopter, as the missile went screaming by Dopey, who was still climbing up, leaving him hanging from one of the skids.

"What are you waiting for? Get in!"

As he climbed in, she spun the helicopter flat, and another missile flew past, splashing them. She whizzed past, towards the mountains, breaking line of sight among the hills as she took a lazy route around Seattle, then popping up closer to the landing strip and blending in with traffic.
