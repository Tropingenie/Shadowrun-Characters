Forwarded job by fixer. After their response, they were given an address in Snohomish, pointing to a "Jo√£o's Foreign Import Mechanic"

As soon as she got the notification, she hopped in her FunOne, setting GridGuide to take her to Snohomish.

Still, with traffic she was going to be an hour late, arriving around the same time as Dokkalfar.

She spotted an LS patrol car pottering around, but he gave them no trouble.

Seeing either a short elf or a tall dwarf, Flintlock gave a casual greeting in Sperethiel, to which Dokk replied with a native, but German, timbre.

With all 4 present, they linked DNI... And found Flintlock didn't have DNI. She used her usual AR kludge.

Shortly after, a dwarf walked into the room. His mouth twitched slightly at the sight of them.

He spoke in a German accent. "So you're the team of couriers my friend hired."

After some questions from the team, he lead them into the garage, which was devoid of any equipment like the prior room.

He pulled three modestly sized briefcases out of the office, telling them to drop each of them off at locations in Pullayup.

"It's important these are delivered in a timely manner, preferably before tomorrow morning."

When questioned why he needed Shadowrunners, he deflected, saying his colleague was busy.

He invited them into the office, closing the door to activate a white noise machine to mask their conversation.

He told them more about the job, reiterating the location, then turning on a trid showing a map of the Seattle metroplex, zooming to the locations of interest.

He looked at the three elves, mentioning Ancients and Laesa were likely OpFor, as that was who the job was against despite the two groups being at odds with one another.

When asked pay, he procured a block of gold, saying they each get three.

The team wasn't happy with that, and Flintlock agreed internally with the Black Witch's concerns about civilian casualties.

Dokkalfar also briefly switched the conversation to German for a question.

After they decided to take the job, Dokkalfar took one last push, mentioning that as Runners they needed information, and if any info was witheld and things went wrong, guns and bullets were their only recompense. This caused the Johnson to fold.

"I don't know my friend anymore, and I like his new friends even less."

Legwork:
- The Big O
    - Bar that has a "particular patronage" that need to no longer have access
    - Neutral ground between the gangs of Pullayup and even Fort Louis
    - A Laesa/Ancients meet is scheduled for tonight
    - Watching the bar camera feed, Ancients picked the second door on the left
- An airfield by the border
    - Typical smuggler spot
    - Used by "people who are acting against the cause"
- The Black Lotus Casino
    - Just north of the Big O
    - Owned by an ally of the Johnson
    - Rumor of really shady things
    - Established himself in Pullayup and has higher ambititions
    - Local gumi works in other fields, the colour scheme seems to imply Triad, though they don't have a prescence in Pullayup
    - Laesa however do have a presence

After casing Big O, Purple and Flintlock began their assault. He lent her his RPC, and they approached, passing an Ancients patrol roaring around on their Harley's.

A basic fence surrounded the Big O, keeping the squalor of Pullayup out. Trash, feces, maybe even a body.

With no second floor windows in sight, they began moving for the second floor door, gathering debris to get over the fence.

Flint fired her grapple gun at the roof, and they easily climbed up, then Purple picked the maglock.

They descended the stairs, creeping past the Ancients in the main room as more Ancients showed up outside, overhearing their four way argument, accusations being thrown at the bartender regarding his professionalism among other insults.

Purple made a bit of noise getting an access panel off to hide the bomb, Flintlock strained her ears but nobody was approaching the room. As they resealed the panel, Dokkalfar spoke over the micro tranceiver:

"Drek, their firewall made me."

Dokkalfar bought them a few minutes, and the inside team began their exfil through the rear door, since some Ancients were moving towards the roof. Purple shot looper rounds to fool the cams, and they jumped the fence. Flint got caught on the fence, but Purple lubed her up and they were on their way.

She changed her gloves, to get a better grip on things, and cleaned up once they reached the car.

END PART 1

Postgame Notes:
    - Trode patch (important for DNI)
    - Basic BNE gear

Game 2: Problems with Running a Train
2025-06-12
GM: allarionn
Players:
clara8787 as Freak12 the Technomancer
s_jeru as Agent X the Face/Driver
sora9567 as Esteem the Mage
Pon Pon (myself) as Flintlock the Muscle
with special guest drbraddock as Hotshot the Rigger/VTOL guy

(in media res)

Objective to acquire goods on a moving bullet train. That can move from Seattle to LA in 2 hours.

After the meet, we went to LA to plan and board the train. We have to intercept a package en route from Dallas to Atlanta.

We pick up as the train is pulling away from Dallas, at about 8:00 in the evening. Hotshot shadowed the train in his VTOL.

The team intercepted the package, and Agent X acquired the package in the oversized compartment. And found a bomb, with 5 minutes 47 seconds on the clock.

Esteem, leaving the dining car near the front of the train, noticed "shaped charges" connecting the front of the train.

Hearing from Agent X, Flintlock and Freak began moving to the rear of the train. Freak, with permission, climbed on Flint's back.

Suddenly, comms exploded--Hotshot had gotten hit. Clear as day, he was gone.

Flintlock, exhausted, powered through despite the difficulty her weak arms had carrying Freak while Esteem examined the bomb through Agent X's image link.

As Agent X moved away, Flintlock and Freak considered notifying the authorities using her knowledge of law enforcement, when the jammers on the train fired.

Flintlock went to move to the next car... And the button didn't work. She frantically pressed it over and over.

"Drek"

She began rifling through her bag, pulling out a micro tranceiver. Relaying what Freak told her... Nobody responded.

She cursed at her team in Speretiel, "Does nobody have a fragging tranceiver?!"

Spotting a panel, Freak told Flint to shoot it open. She reached over and opened it using the handle that Freak hadn't been able to see amidst the chaos.

Flint, meanwhile, was sprayed in the face with purple tracking dye.

"At least it matches my hair..." she muttered, taking her glasses off to clean them as Freak accessed the UDP and opened the doors.

(Intimidation and leadership may be necessary skills lol)

Freak asked if Flint could open a secured hatch from inside the train. Flintlock, needing to pull out her gun, had a contigency for this...

(Flashback to their dingy safehouse in Dallas)

Sat on plastic furniture, they were discussing the plan.

"If I'm gonna pull out milspec weapons, I could use a SIN..."

The team were putting together disguises. Flintlock managed to apply everyone's makeup professionally, even turning Freak into a normal person.

Flint also picked up a burner SIN (Kyoko contact, Burner SIN, Rating 4, 6 licenses, issued by MCT) as a Petrovski employee.

(End flashback)

Flintlock took control of the situation.

"Transit authority! Everyone remain calm, the situation is under control."

Swapping her rifle for a magazine loaded with explosive ammo, she began clearing the civilians from around the hatch.

As she did so, the PA announced "Everybody is to remain in their seats. This train is under control of Alamos 20k."

It was a terrorist threat.

The train car exploded with noise, but Flintlock shouted louder.

"They'll take this car over my dead body! I'm here to protect you, so get down and get out of my way!"

She popped a hole in the maintenance panel for Freak, then returned to overwatch, putting on her forearm guards and popping betameth.

(Addiction test: 11-9 = 2 bonus dice, addiction type both so LOG + WIL = 7, rating 3, 3 successes)

+2 Reaction, +1 Intuition,

Meanwhile, Esteem sealed the front car while Freak took control of the host from the undercarriage. Freak began negotiations while Agent X finally managed to reconnect with part of the team.

The team talked a lot about what to do next, eventually settling on a plan.

Flintlock reloaded, prepping two mags of explosive ammo, and moving with Agent X to recover their longarms. (shooting 1 more hatch)

She set up with her rifle to take out the guard in the rear from two cars away. With perfect timing, waiting for the train to reach a straight piece of track, Freak opened the door and Flintlock send a round downrange, instantly killing the lone terrorist.

"Beautiful work. Time to move on to the next phase," said Agent X.

After the frazzler god (Esteem) frazzeled, he told them to prep for ingress. Then he solo cleared the next car.

Agent X opened the door and they engaged. Agent X lay down suppressive fire, while Flint fired a 3 round burst and Esteem's spirit bent metal behind them to close off retreat.

A goon tried to grab Agent X, who dodged, and fire came back. Flint took a single shot, then returned fire, downing the enemy suppressing them.

Flint took another hit, knocking her down, while Agent X took another goon out with his Ares. She took another shot from the ground with her rifle, but her wounds were getting to her and she missed.

As Esteem cleaned up from behind, Agent X took out the second to last goon. Who reached down and pulled the pin of a grenade.

A flashbang went off.

Agent X cleanly avoided any effects, while Flint nearly passed out. She took a single shot, hitting the goon, as she retreated.

With HTR en-route, Flint shut her Docwagon bracelet off as the team prepared for exfil, while Freak spoke with the MCT controllers.

They limped into a town near Dallas, rented a room and cleaned up at a motel. "Just got back at Burning Man" Agent X quipped.

In Dallas, they made the handoff with a nervous Johnson, who was pleased the team got a way clean.

"There's a story there, but I don't think I wanna hear it."

CSR: Seraph
GM: Penne42 (Penny)
Players:
arcanecandelabra as Hyperlink the Technomancer
Fancy Rat as Fancy the Rigger Adept
Pon Pon (myself) as Flintlock the Muscle

Legwork
- Swapped sniper rounds for sporting rifle rounds through contacts (GM approved)
- Drop seemed clean
- Car may be on LoneStar records
- Flintlock considering setting up on the bridge over the impound, but garage makes that less relevant
- Contacted Jade about any flaws, she mentioned astral security, one of the guards carried a keycard
- Had Simon drive her to the Impound Lot to rizz up a guard (she owes Simon 50 nuyen), didn't rizz well
- Cased the joint on the walk up
- Guards have badges
- Some auged, all armed and armoured
- No chemseal visible
- About 15 total, looking into the building from outside
- Bollards blocking the driveway
- Drone egresses up the building
- Two spirits, focused on upper halves
- Slight sightline if the door were opened from the raised road behind
- On ingress (walk in from the front?): 
- SIN will be checked, going into building full of forensics and lawyers would require extreme precision to bypass the checks
- Whatever face used is going to be spotted by all the cameras, but needs to match the face on the SIN
- Walking out the door with the car is near impossible, too high risk to even use this to case the place
- Garage analysis
- Not much lower than 3 floors down, between 1-3
- Impound likely towards the back/bottom
- Service/cargo elevator internal, central elevator shaft, two stairwells/fire exits on opposite sides

The Plan:
Lael John Sinner
Steal the keycard
Sneak in the fire escape
Steal the car
Profit

The Run:
Flint slept in, forcing the team to get the keycard themselves. She woke up to many angry messages from Hyperlink. They less than social Technomancer and Rigger did their best by the seat of their pants. The group reconvened, ready to engage. Hyperlink said "it's decking time" and proceeded to deck everywhere, while team F snuck up and entered through the fire escape. At the bottom of the stairs, two floors down, they heard two people having a conversation, about two meters away from the door. Flintlock sneakily opened the door, set a gas grenade down, and let it rip. They heard three thuds, then moved through the door, picking up the grenade casing, seeing three Lone Star officers on the ground. The car of interest was dead ahead, plain as day. Flintlock began moving the bodies out of the way of any cameras, which could see the guards after the runner team was finished, while Fancy got to work on getting the car moving. She couldn't make heads or tails of the electronics, forcing them to search for the key--taking 20 minutes. In the background, a Spider engaged with Hyperlink, who began opening the gates and preparing to crash the LoneStar host. Her sprite slammed the host, and... It did not go down. To Flintlock and Fancy, they only hear "the way is clear" before she drops offline. Fancy drove them out, and Flintlock immediately wanted to check on Hyperlink. Fancy began driving toward where she had parked her car, "Pinto." Fancy asked what to do next, to which Flintlock suggested just making the drop. Flintlock arrived just in the nick of time, shoving Hyperlink in the Valkyrie module moments before death.
